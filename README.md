# Cubes
QT OpenGl Instanced cubes

This is the QT opengl example cube, upgraded to opengl4.3, to allow instancing of cubes.

Cubes are drawn using instancing from SSBO buffer.

Compute shader can manipulate cubes

Culling implemented by identifying hidden cubes

All done as a painful experiment in using opengl directly instead of Unity!
